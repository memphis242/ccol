/**
 * @brief Generic interface to a user-provided allocator.
 * @note The intended use of such an allocator is to provide allocations of
 *       arbitrary sizes of contiguous bytes (e.g., for the array that underlies
 *       a Vector object).
 * @note In contrast, allocations of fixed size objects (e.g., the struct that
 *       represents a Vector) will be handled internally, and will likely be
 *       static pools of those fixed-size objects. The size of such pools will
 *       be user configurable through a macro (e.g., cfg/vector_cfg.h).
 * @note All function members take a void * arena parameter that may be used
 *       by an implementation to carry out the allocations/reclamations. This is
 *       likely going to be a user-defined struct (e.g., struct Arena { uint8_t
 *       start; uint8_t end; uint8_t * bump_ptr; } ) that is cast from void *
 *       to the user-defined struct type in the allocator fcn implementations.
 *
 * Since the user supplies the functions to make up their allocator of choice,
 * they are flexible to pick an allocator that suits their needs. If the allocator
 * function prototypes don't exactly match this struct, it is likely trivial
 * to make wrapper functions around the desired allocator functions.
 *
 * For instance, on the one end, one could just use the DEFAULT_ALLOCATOR, which
 * ties wrappers around the stdlib malloc, realloc, and free functions, with
 * nothing provided for the alloca_init member. On another end, one can use a
 * simple "bump-allocator" scheme (aka, stack alloactor), that simply increments
 * a pointer that indicates the location of the next block to be allocated (note
 * that this scheme, while efficient, isn't great at freeing blocks in arbitrary
 * order), and such an implementation can at run-time provide the pool from which
 * the allocator acts upon. And there's plenty in between!
 *
 * @param alloc   Fcn that allocates memory and returns a pointer to the start
 *                of that memory.
 * @param realloc Fcn that takes a ptr to a previously allocated block and
 *                resizes it, returning a pointer to that new block.
 * @param reclaim Fcn that "reclaims" (i.e., frees) a previously allocated block
 *                pointed to by the passed-in ptr.
 * @param alloca_init A init fcn for the allocator - e.g., may be used to
 *                    initialize subdivisions of the arena argument and compute
 *                    free lists, from which allocations, splitting, coalescence,
 *                    etc., may be done.
 * @param arena   The pool of memory from which allocations are made from.
