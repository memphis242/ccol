## Coding Standards

- Reference the [CODING_PRINCIPLES.md](../CODING_PRINCIPLES.md) for the the principles behind the code and the repo setup.
- Follow the coding style used in the existing codebase. The code should generally look like it was written by one entity.
- Write clear and concise comments where necessary but keep things [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- Documentation/Comment Style:
   - Header files are the primary documentation for the end-user
   - Use doxygen-style comments/tags so that Doxygen can generate documents for those who prefer that
   - Comments in source files should just be the why/how of non-obvious code constructs

- Please ensure that your contributions are aligned with the project's goals and principles as outlined in the README.md.
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions and reviews.
